we want predict the salary of the employee with his experience?

Salary ---Output/Target/labels
Experience --- Input/features



what is the possible output/target  in this problem
	is it continuous values or discrete values?
	12000
	16000
	30000
	50000



discrete values 
	if the values fixed


we want to findout person has cancer or not?

	possible target
		yes/no
		1/0
		true/false





we split the samples/data
	training data
	testing data



Customer sigmentation
	banking
	flipkart





we want predict the salary of the employee with his experience?

1. Get data
	we required past data of employee experience and salaries
	a) different companies websites
	b) search in google to get required data
	c) verify public repositories 
	d) Conducting lucky draws
	e) google fourms
	d) generate the dummy data with formulaes(y=mx+c)
2. Pre-processing
	we have to verify the data
	to check any missing values?
	to check any invalid values?
	apply data analysis

	
	
	
	example you gathered patients data in that you have 2 columns	
	patient _id   , fever in degrees
	ramu 		80
	raju 		90
	lakshmi		1000

	

	
	

3. Train model
	a) identify the algorithm
	b) seperate the features and target
	c) if possible split the data for training and testing
	d) create the object for algorithm
	e) train the algorithm with training data

4. Test model
	by using testing data we have to test the model

5. Improve the model
	1. features selection
	2. features combination
	3. Parameter tuning
	4. getting more samples to train the machine



















we build the model to predict person has cancer or not?
	model with 98% accuracy
	2% chance model fail to predict
i went to hospital to check i am effected with cancer or not
	i may get cancer 








we want to know performance of student by conducting exam?

teacher given 10 questions to students each question has 1 mark

students given correct answers for 6 questions
in this situation what performance of the student
	
correct_answers/no of question

	6/10
	60%
